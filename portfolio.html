    <h2><strong><u>Progression Log</u></strong></h2>
    <div>
    <p>Milestone 1</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Watched a very useful video that helped me understand how to use github pages and how to start new web pages 
            (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyFcl_Fba-k">Getting Started With Github Pages</a>) </li>
        <li>Finished reading the MarkSheet.io HTML tutorial and applied what I had learned to my portfolio.</li>
        <li>Read the CSS MarkSheet.io and added some basic styling to the Portfolio.</li>
        <li>Downloaded mimo app and began html and css quizes. The quizes are very helpful in getting a base level understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript <img src="mimoapp.jpg" alt="mimo" class="progressImage"></li>
        <li>Completed the beginner HTML and CSS tutorials on htmldog.com and uploaded the web page</li>
        <li>Watched the course capture of the in class tutorial and completed the web page that Dr. Bart showed us</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div>
    <p>Milestone 2</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Completed the HTMLDog beginner tutorial for javascript. <a href="https://htmldog.com/guides/javascript/">HTML Dog JS</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>This tutorial taught me basic javascript through using it in the browser console. It taught basic ideas such as variables, variable usage, basic math, and logic
                    with booleans. The most important thing for using variables in javascript that I got from this tutorial was using the "var" keyword to create a variable where as in 
                    other languages you would have to specify the type of variable. The general "var" keyword is interesting. This tutorial also taught some other basic ideas such as 
                    if/else statements, while loops, for loops, functions, objects, and arrays. As stated in the tutorial, this language can store functions in variables which
                    is quite different from anything I have experienced and is something I am excited to mess around with in later web pages.
