    <h2><strong><u>Progression Log</u></strong></h2>
    <div>
    <h3>Milestone 1</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Watched a very useful video that helped me understand how to use github pages and how to start new web pages 
            (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyFcl_Fba-k">Getting Started With Github Pages</a>) </li>
        <li>Finished reading the MarkSheet.io HTML tutorial and applied what I had learned to my portfolio.</li>
        <li>Read the CSS MarkSheet.io and added some basic styling to the Portfolio.</li>
        <li>Downloaded mimo app and began html and css quizes. The quizes are very helpful in getting a base level understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript <img src="mimoapp.jpg" alt="mimo" class="progressImage"></li>
        <li>Completed the beginner HTML and CSS tutorials on htmldog.com and uploaded the web page</li>
        <li>Watched the course capture of the in class tutorial and completed the web page that Dr. Bart showed us</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div>
    <h3>Milestone 2</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Completed the HTMLDog beginner tutorial for javascript. <a href="https://htmldog.com/guides/javascript/">HTML Dog JS</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>This tutorial taught me basic javascript through using it in the browser console. It taught basic ideas such as variables, variable usage, basic math, and logic
                    with booleans. The most important thing for using variables in javascript that I got from this tutorial was using the "var" keyword to create a variable where as in 
                    other languages you would have to specify the type of variable. The general "var" keyword is interesting. This tutorial also taught some other basic ideas such as 
                    if/else statements, while loops, for loops, functions, objects, and arrays. As stated in the tutorial, this language can store functions in variables which
                    is quite different from anything I have experienced and is something I am excited to mess around with in later web pages.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Completed the HTMLDog intermediate tutorial for javascript. <a href="https://htmldog.com/guides/javascript/">HTML Dog JS></a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The first part of this tutorial was very useful in learning about how to manipulate the DOM. It gave many examples on different was to find specific elements
                    from the DOM using built in javascript functions. It also demonstrated how events work in javascript. This section will be very important due to most if not all 
                    web apps being reliant on some event from the user. Additionally, it explained how JSON works and how it used to transfer information. Scope was another topic 
                    that seems very important as it is quite different from other programing languages. The tutorial called it functional scope. The most interesting portion of scope
                    to me is the idea of child scope. It seems as tho you can create a function that declares a variable and create a child function inside that function that has access
                    to that variable. The final few sections of the tutorial were about jQuery and some of the basics of the library. Overall this tutorial seems to give the basic tools
                    to start writing some javascript for web pages and should be very useful in the future. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Completed the Typescript Lang tutorial <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html">Typescript tutorial</a></li>
        <ul>
            <li>This tutorial gave a very basic overview of what typescript does and how it works with javascript. As the name implies, Typescipt helps javascript in a number of 
                different ways with types. The tutorial goes over a few of the ways Typescript improves javascripts types like getting types by inference, defining types and composing
                types. What I found most interesting is the idea of Unions. Being able to enter different types into a function and recieve a different return based on the input can 
                allow very creative and useful functions to be made. The last thing the tutorial discusses is the structural type system that Typescript uses. This allows to
                create variables with necessarily specifying a type as long as you declare it with the correct shape.
