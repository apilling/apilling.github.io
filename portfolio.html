    <h2><strong><u>Progression Log</u></strong></h2>
    <div>
    <h3>Milestone 1</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Watched a very useful video that helped me understand how to use github pages and how to start new web pages 
            (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyFcl_Fba-k">Getting Started With Github Pages</a>) </li>
        <li>Finished reading the MarkSheet.io HTML tutorial and applied what I had learned to my portfolio.</li>
        <li>Read the CSS MarkSheet.io and added some basic styling to the Portfolio.</li>
        <li>Downloaded mimo app and began html and css quizes. The quizes are very helpful in getting a base level understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript <img src="mimoapp.jpg" alt="mimo" class="progressImage"></li>
        <li>Completed the beginner HTML and CSS tutorials on htmldog.com and uploaded the web page</li>
        <li>Watched the course capture of the in class tutorial and completed the web page that Dr. Bart showed us</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div>
    <h3>Milestone 2</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Completed the HTMLDog beginner tutorial for javascript. <a href="https://htmldog.com/guides/javascript/">HTML Dog JS</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>This tutorial taught me basic javascript through using it in the browser console. It taught basic ideas such as variables, variable usage, basic math, and logic
                    with booleans. The most important thing for using variables in javascript that I got from this tutorial was using the "var" keyword to create a variable where as in 
                    other languages you would have to specify the type of variable. The general "var" keyword is interesting. This tutorial also taught some other basic ideas such as 
                    if/else statements, while loops, for loops, functions, objects, and arrays. As stated in the tutorial, this language can store functions in variables which
                    is quite different from anything I have experienced and is something I am excited to mess around with in later web pages.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Completed the HTMLDog intermediate tutorial for javascript. <a href="https://htmldog.com/guides/javascript/">HTML Dog JS></a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The first part of this tutorial was very useful in learning about how to manipulate the DOM. It gave many examples on different was to find specific elements
                    from the DOM using built in javascript functions. It also demonstrated how events work in javascript. This section will be very important due to most if not all 
                    web apps being reliant on some event from the user. Additionally, it explained how JSON works and how it used to transfer information. Scope was another topic 
                    that seems very important as it is quite different from other programing languages. The tutorial called it functional scope. The most interesting portion of scope
                    to me is the idea of child scope. It seems as tho you can create a function that declares a variable and create a child function inside that function that has access
                    to that variable. The final few sections of the tutorial were about jQuery and some of the basics of the library. Overall this tutorial seems to give the basic tools
                    to start writing some javascript for web pages and should be very useful in the future. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Completed the Typescript Lang tutorial <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html">Typescript tutorial</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>This tutorial gave a very basic overview of what typescript does and how it works with javascript. As the name implies, Typescipt helps javascript in a number of 
                    different ways with types. The tutorial goes over a few of the ways Typescript improves javascripts types like getting types by inference, defining types and composing
                    types. What I found most interesting is the idea of Unions. Being able to enter different types into a function and recieve a different return based on the input can 
                    allow very creative and useful functions to be made. The last thing the tutorial discusses is the structural type system that Typescript uses. This allows to
                    create variables with necessarily specifying a type as long as you declare it with the correct shape.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Created first react based on Dr. Barts in class lessons. Repository Link: <a href="https://github.com/apilling/react-experiment-app">Repository link</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>I created this react app based on Dr. Barts lessons from this week of class and had some ideas to try out for myself. However I ran into an issue with
                    github pages and could not get the page to properly display from the github pages link. The code compiles and works fine when using the "start" script from
                    the JSON file. I gave the repo link above so that the code can still be viewed. I would like to get this working as soon as possible so I can test more 
                    Typescript code in a react app. I will continue working on it and hopefully get it to work soon. However, writing the code itself was very useful and it taught 
                    me how to do a lot of cool things with typescript and react. For example, creating a toggle for the swap button required me to create a child function inside 
                    of another function. Also, learning how to use useState will be extremely benificial in the future. Once I get the web page to display properly from github 
                    pages, I plan to add new things like a text box with an enter button that will display the text typed in below when the enter button is pressed.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Continued to use the Mimo app to practice HTML, CSS, and now starting to do some javascript modules. The ideas are basic but very important to building
            strong foundational knowledge of these three topics. The daily reinforcement will help me truely know the basics of HTML, CSS, and javascript inside and out.

        <h3>Milestone 3</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Completed the HTML Dog advanced tutorial for javascript. <a href="https://htmldog.com/guides/javascript/">HTML Dog</a> </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This tutorial takes you through some of the advanced aspects of javascript. It starts with an introduction to object oriented programming in javascript
                        touching on ideas like constructors, encapsulation, and inheritance. Most of it seemed quite similar to what I have already learned about object oriented
                        programming outside of a few small details such as calling the parent object a prototype. It also discusses how to create elements using javascript without
                        using HTML. I have already attempted this a bit in the react_experiment_app and it is quite useful in creating unique elements specifically tailored for 
                        the app you are creating. I plan on using this feature quite a bit when I create my snake web app. Some of the later sections went into Angular and a few
                        other things so I chose not to read too deeply into them.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Completed Dr. Bart's video tutorial for ta-trainer react web app. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8eYF6cUi5c">Youtube Video</a></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This video allowed me to create a fully functioning web app and showed off some of the cool things you can do in React. It also helped me gain a better
                        understanding of TypeScript concepts such as useState. I now know what my web apps should look like when the portfolio needs to be completed. 
                    </li>
                    <li>App link : <a href="https://apilling.github.io/react-experiment-app/">https://apilling.github.io/react-experiment-app/</a></li>
                    <li>Repo Link: <a href=""></a></li>
                </ul>
            <li>Added some basic tests to Dr. Barts ta-trainer during in class testing demo. <a href="https://github.com/apilling/ta-trainer.git">ta-trainer repo</a></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I did not get too deep into testing, but it was a good first attempt. It at least allowed me to get a basic idea of how you would begin to write some tests
                        for your web app. I added basic things like testing that the card viewer was on the screen and that the "add new card" button actually added something.
                        Additionally, I tested that closing the "add new card" modal did not change anything on the screen and just exited the modal. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Began work on my snake game web app <a href="https://apilling.github.io/snake-game-app/index.html">Snake Game</a></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The game board was a bit more complex than I thought it would be but I found a very helpful guide on the internet.
                        <a href="https://dev.to/aligumustosun/making-a-snake-game-using-react-hooks-5606">(Guide)</a>
                        The game board will use mapped images to display everything. The original matrix is a string matrix and the image of a plain orange square
                        are mapped to each of the strings in the matrix in the SnakeBoard function. Next week, I plan to implement the snake plus the food. Time permitting 
                        I would also like to add difficulties so players can adjust the speed at which the snake moves.
                    </li>
